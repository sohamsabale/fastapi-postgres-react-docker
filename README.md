# DombivliFacts.com : A Simple Web App with LLM Integration
Welcome to my learning project! This is a simple web application I built to explore fullstack development. It includes a user-friendly interface, a backend server, a database to store information, and a LLM wrapper to interact with Google's Gemini Models.
I have used DigitalOcean to host the website here - www.dombivlifacts.com . However, I cannot confirm how long it will stay up! Stuff's expensive! 

# What's Inside

- A webpage you can interact with (built with React)
- A server that handles requests (using FastAPI)
- A database to store information (PostgreSQL)
- An LLM to converse with 


## Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need Docker installed on your computer. Docker makes it easy to set up and run the application without worrying about individual component installations.
How to Run the App

## Clone this project to your computer:

'''git clone https://github.com/sohamsabale/fastapi-postgres-react-docker.git
cd fastapi-postgres-react-docker'''

## Build and start the application using Docker:
'''docker compose up --build'''

## Once everything is up and running, open your web browser and go to:
http://localhost :3000


That's it! You should now see the application running in your browser.

## What You Can Do
- Explore the web interface
- Interact with the chatbot
- Add and view data 

## Project Structure
Here's a simple breakdown of what's in this project:
